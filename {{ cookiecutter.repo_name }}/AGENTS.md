## 📌 General Rules

- Write code **professionally**:
  - Clear, well-structured, and well-documented.
  - Follow best practices for code quality: proper naming, modularity, readability.
  - Include comprehensive tests to ensure reliability and maintainability.
  - Make it easy to understand and use by other developers.
  - Ensure all written text is free from spelling and grammatical errors.

## 📁 `agents/` Folder

This is your **workspace for planning and coordination**.

- Use this folder to **externalize your thoughts, plans, and decisions** instead of keeping them “in your head”. This way you can instruct yourself and others after you.
- If this folder is not empty, it likely contains work from previous agents — read it before continuing.

**Folder structure recommendations:**
- `agents/README.md` — explains the structure of this folder and how to use it.
- `agents/TODO.md` — a running checklist of tasks; mark tasks as `- [ ]` (to do), `- [~]` (in progress), and `- [x]` (done).
- Optional subfolders (`planning/`, `rules/`, `research/`, etc.) to keep content organized.

**Housekeeping:**
- Keep this folder tidy and updated; archive or remove outdated plans.
- Prefer small, focused documents rather than long, messy files.

## ❓ Asking for Help

- If you are uncertain about anything, **ask questions instead of guessing**.
- You may ask about:
  - Technical details
  - Project goals or priorities
  - Best practices and conventions
  - Etc.
- Asking early helps avoid rework and ensures alignment with the project’s direction.
